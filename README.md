# Mini Translate

Mini Translate aims to translate a few English words on every page to Chinese.
This way it's easy to study a little bit every day, without having to read a whole article in Chinese,
which can be tedious and demotivating.

Supports **Simplified** and **Traditional** Chinese characters.
**Hover** over the translated characters to see an explanation and **pinyin**.

- [x] Traditional support
- [ ] Styling
- [ ] Support feedback for individual mismatches
