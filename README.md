# Mini Translate


#### Updates

Dec 2017: Updated to v2 with major speed improvements and more words per page.

#### Main

Mini Translate aims to translate a few English words on every page to Chinese.
This way it's easy to study a little bit every day, without having to read a whole article in Chinese,
which can be tedious and demotivating.

Supports **Simplified** and **Traditional** Chinese characters.
**Hover** over the translated characters to see an explanation and **pinyin**.

- [x] Traditional support
- [x] Color coded tones
- [x] Alternative matches on hover

Try it out and let me know if there are any issues. Submit them via Github

Please note that I cannot translate every word with 100% accuracy,
as I would need to analyze the whole text for that.
Therefore, hovering over a word gives you the ability to see the most likely matches.
